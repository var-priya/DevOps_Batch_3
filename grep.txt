GREP----------

grep (global regular expression print) will search input files for a search
string, and print the lines that match it.

grep "string" file_name
grep -r <search_string> filename
grep <serach string> filename >newfilename
grep -i <search_string> filename (for insensitive string)
grep -n "string" file_name (for including number of lines)
grep -vn "string" file_name(for opposite result)
grep -c "string" file_name (to print only number of lines)
grep -x "string" file_name (to print exactly )
grep -l "string" file_name (prints only the filenames of files in the query that have lines that match the search
string.)
